I, nik frank, am writing this for educational purposes

I've done some tweaks to the .storybook webpack,
I can't remember why nor what unfortunately.

It was a minor bug fix though, and I think I submitted it in a github comment!

idk if I have to mention that kadira made storybook (which I'm using)
even if I don't have to though, it's an honour to do so.

google them and check out their stuff!
